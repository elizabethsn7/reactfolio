							For over fifteen years I was an innocent and naive freelance
							photographer happily clicking away. Then, one day, I came upon the
							beautiful complexity and entanglement of coding. It was love at
							first sight. I became challenged in a way I hadnâ€™t been before and
							the desire to learn more about it was too strong to turn away.
							<br />
							Because of my previous professional experience, I bring to the
							table the unicornian (yeah, I made that up) magic of design and
							development.
